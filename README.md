# vscode-maybs-quit

Extension for VS Code inspired by [Maybs-Quit package from Sublime Text](https://github.com/xavi-/sublime-maybs-quit)

Quote :

> Why are <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> (close file) and <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> (quit) right next to each other?!?! I'm just trying to close a file, but for some insane reason my pinky drifts 1cm to the left and suddenly sublime disappears.
